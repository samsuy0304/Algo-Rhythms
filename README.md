# Algo-Rhythms

Welcome to Algo-Rhythms, the repository of all algorithms! 

Are you tired of searching all over the internet for different algorithms? Do you want to have all the algorithms in one place? Look no further! Algo-Rhythms has you covered.

This repository contains folders for all the algorithms I have learned, and each folder contains a README file with instructions on how to use the algorithm. I have everything from Dijkstra's algorithm to the Knapsack problem, and I am constantly adding more algorithms.

So what are you waiting for? Browse our repository and discover the algorithms that will help you conquer your coding challenges. Who knows, you might even have some fun along the way!

## List of Algorithms

* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Verlet algorithm
* Sorting algorithms

## Contributing
