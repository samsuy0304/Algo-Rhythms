# Verlet Algorithm
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Verlet algorithm in Python. The Verlet algorithm is a numerical method for solving second-order ordinary differential equations, such as the equations of motion in classical mechanics.

The Verlet algorithm is a popular method for simulating the motion of particles in a variety of physical systems, including molecular dynamics, astrophysics, and fluid mechanics. The algorithm is simple to implement and has good accuracy and stability properties.

## Requirements
This implementation requires Python 3 and the`matplotlib` module.

## Contents
The repository contains the following files:

VelocityVerlet_Projectile_VaribleDrag.py : Example of Velocity verlet to visualize the projectile motion, in presence of drag updated based on density at every altitude.

Velocity_Verlet_ConstantDrag.py : Example of Velocity verlet to visualize the projectile motion, in presence of constant drag.

Verlet_Pendulum.py : Example of Velocity verlet to visualize the simple pendulum motion.

Verlet_SimpleProjectile.py : Example of Velocity verlet to visualize the projectile motion, no drag.
