## Introduction

This Python script uses NumPy and Matplotlib to visualize the Knight's Tour on an 8x8 chessboard. The starting position of the knight is chosen, and the script calculates the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach each square on the board.

## Features

- Visualization of the Knight's Tour on an 8x8 chessboard.
- Calculation of the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach each square.
- Color-coded grid indicating the number of steps required to reach each square.

## Usage

1. Open the `knight_tour.py` script in your preferred Python environment.

2. Choose the starting position of the knight by setting the `start_x` and `start_y` variables.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python knight_tour.py
    ```
